The minimum recommended number of servers is three, and five is the most common in a production environment. The replicated group of servers in the same application domain is called a quorum.

A stat simply provides the metadata of a znode. It consists of Version number, Action control list (ACL), Timestamp and Data length.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.5</td><td>ZooKeeper has primarily two types of znodes: persistent and ephemeral. There is a third type called a sequential znode, which is a kind of a qualifier for the other two types. Both persistent and ephemeral znodes can be sequential znodes as well. A znode&#39;s type is set at the time of its creation.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES - The Persistent Znode</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.5</td><td>The persistent znodes have a lifetime in the ZooKeeper&#39;s namespace until these are explicitly deleted.

This is similar to a push model, where notifications are pushed to the registered clients of the ZooKeeper service. Watches are a simple mechanism for the client to get notifications about the changes in the ZooKeeper ensemble. Clients can set watches while reading a particular znode. Watches send a notification to the registered client for any of the znode (on which client registers) changes. Znode changes are modification of data associated with the znode or changes in the znode’s children. Watches are triggered only once. If a client wants a notification again, it must be done through another read operation. When a connection session is expired, the client will be disconnected from the server and the associated watches are also removed. Watches are maintained in the ZooKeeper server to which a client is connected, and this makes it a fast and lean method of event notification.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper operations</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.8</td><td>Operation with their description</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper operations</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.9</td><td>Read requests are processed locally in the ZooKeeper server &amp; Write requests are forwarded to the leader.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper operations</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.9</td><td>All of the read operations in ZooKeeper - getData(), getChildren(), and exists() - have the option of setting a watch for notification to the client.

<h1>Other</h1>
<ul>
<li>tickTime: This is measured in milliseconds; it is used for session registration and to do regular heartbeats by clients with the Zookeeper service. The minimum session timeout will be twice the tickTime parameter</li>
<li>dataDir: This is the location to store the in-memory stats of ZooKeeper; it includes database snapshots and the transaction log of updates to the databases. Extracting the ZooKeeper archive won&#39;t create this directory, so if this directory doesn&#39;t exist in the system, you will need to create and set writable permission to it.</li>
<li>clientPort: This is the port that listens for client connections, so it is where the ZooKeeper clients will initiate a connection. The client port can be set to any number, and different servers can be configured to listen on different ports. The default is 2181.</li>
<li>initLimit: This paramter is the time out, specified in number of ticks, for a follower to initially connect to a leader. To allow followers to connect and synchronize to a leader. Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by Zookeeper is large.</li>
<li>syncLimit: This is the timeout, specified in number of ticks, for a follower to sync with a leader.</li>
<li>two port number after each server hostname: first is mostly used for peer-to-peer communication in the quorum, suck as connect followers to leaders; second port is used for leader election, in case a new leader arises in the quorum.</li>
<li>dataLogDir: This option will direct the machine to write the transaction log to the dataLogDir rather than the dataDir. This allows a dedicated log device to be used, and helps avoid comptition between logging and snapshots.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Storage Configuration</h2>
<p><strong>globalOutstandingLimit</strong>
(Java system property:<strong><em>*zookeeper.globalOutstandingLimit*</em></strong>.)
Clients can submit requests faster than ZooKeeper can process them, especially if there are a lot of clients. To prevent ZooKeeper from running out of memory due to queued requests, ZooKeeper will throttle clients so that there is no more than globalOutstandingLimit outstanding requests in the system. The default limit is 1,000.</p>
<p><strong>preAllocSize</strong>
(Java system property:<strong><em>*zookeeper.preAllocSize*</em></strong>)
To avoid seeks ZooKeeper allocates space in the transaction log file in blocks of preAllocSize kilobytes. The default block size is 64M. One reason for changing the size of the blocks is to reduce the block size if snapshots are taken more often. (Also, see snapCount)</p>
<p><strong>snapCount</strong>
(Java system property:<strong><em>*zookeeper.snapCount*</em></strong>)
ZooKeeper logs transactions to a transaction log. After snapCount transactions are written to a log file a snapshot is started and a new transaction log file is created. The default snapCount is 100,000.</p>
<p><strong>traceFile</strong>
(Java system property: r<strong><em>*equestTraceFile*</em></strong>)
If this option is defined, requests will be will logged to a trace file named traceFile.year.month.day. Use of this option provides useful debugging information, but will impact performance. (Note: The system property has no zookeeper prefix, and the configuration variable name is different from the system property. Yes - it&#39;s not consistent, and it&#39;s annoying.)</p>
<p><strong>autopurge.snapRetainCount</strong> 
The number of Snapshots and Corresponding transaction logs to retain when purging data.Zookeeper snapshots and transaction logs are periodically garbage collected. The autopurge. snapRetainCount governs the number of the snapshots to retain while garbage collecting. Obviously, not all of the snapshots can be deleted because that would make it impossible to recover a server; the minimum for autopurge snap Retain Count is three, which is also the default.</p>
<p><strong>autopurge.purgeInterval</strong> 
The number of hours to wait between garbage collecting (purging) old snapshots and logs. If set to a nonzero number, autopurge.purgeInterval specifies the period between garbage collection cycles. If set to zero, the default, garbage collection will not be run automatically but should be run manually using the zkCleanup.shscript in the Zookeeper distribution.</p>
<p><strong>fsync.warningthresholdms</strong>
The duration in milieconds of a sync to storage that will trigger a waning (fsynce waningthresoldms). A Zookeeper server will synchronize a change to storage before it acknowledges the change.</p>
<p><strong>weight.x=nnnnn</strong>
(No Java system property)
Used along with &quot;group&quot;, it assigns a weight to a server when forming quorums. Such a value corresponds to the weight of a server when voting. A few parts of Zookeeper require voting such as leader election and the atomic broadcast protocol. By default, the weight of server is one. If the configuration defines groups,but not weights,then a value of one will be assigned to all servers.</p>
<h2>Network Configuration</h2>
<p>These options place limits on communication between servers and clients. Timeouts are also covered in this section:</p>
<p><strong>globalOutstandingLimit</strong>
(Java system property: zookeeper.globalOutstandingLimit.)</p>
<p>Clients can submit requests faster than Zookeeper can process them, especially if there are many clients. To prevent Zookeeper from running out of memory due to queued requests, Zookeeper will throttle clients so that there is no more than globalOutstandingLimit outstanding requests in the system. The default limit is 1,000.</p>
<p><strong>maxClientCnxns</strong> (No Java system property)
Limits the number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a single client, identified by IP address.may make to a single member of the Zookeeper ensemble. This is used to prevent certain classes of DoS attacks.including file descriptor exhaustion. The default is 10. Setting this to zero entirely removes the limit on concurrent connections.</p>
<p><strong>clientPortAddress</strong>
<strong><em>*New in 3.3.0:*</em></strong> the address (ipv4, ipv6 or hostname) to listen for client connections; that is, the address that clients attempt to connect to. This is optional, by default we bind in such a way that any connection to the<strong><em>*clientPort*</em></strong>for any address/interface/nic on the server will be accepted</p>
<p><strong>minSessionTimeout</strong>
(No Java system property)
<strong><em>*New in 3.3.0:*</em></strong> the minimum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 2 times the<strong><em>*tickTime*</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>maxSessionTimeout</strong>
(No Java system property)
<strong><em>*New in 3.3.0:*</em></strong> the maximum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 20 times the<strong><em>*tickTime*</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster Configuration</strong>
When an ensemble of servers provide the ZooKeeper service, we need to configure each server to have the correct timing and server list So that the servers can connect to each other and detect failures. These parameters must be the same on all the Zookeeper servers in the ensemble:</p>
<p><strong>initLimit</strong> (No Java system property)
Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and synchronize to a leader. Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by Zookeeper is large.</p>
<p><strong>leaderServes</strong> (Java system property: zookeeper.leaderServes) 
Leader accepts client connections. Default value is &quot;yes&quot;. The leader machine coordinates updates.For higher update throughput at the slight expense of read throughput, the leader can be configured to not accept clients and focus on coordination. The default to this option is yes, which means that a leader will accept client connections.
Turning on leader selection is highly recommended when you have more than threezookeeper servers in an ensamble.</p>
<p><strong>syncLimit</strong> (No Java system property)
Amount of time, in ticks, to allow followers to synchronize with Zookeeper. If followers fall too far behind aleader, they will be dropped.</p>
<p><strong>server.x=[hostname]:nnnn:nnnnn]</strong> (No Java system property)
Servers making up the Zookeeper ensemble. When the server starts up, it determines which server it is by looking for the file myid in the data directory. That file contains the server number, in ASCII, and it should match x in server.x in the left hand side of this setting.
The list of servers that make up Zookeeper servers that is used by the clients must match the list of Zookeeper servers that each Zookeeper server has.
There are two-port numbers nnnnn. The first followers use to connect to the leader, and the second is for leader election. The leader election port is only necessary if electionAlg is 1, 2, or 3 (default). If electionAlg is 0, then the second port is not necessary. If you want to test multiple servers on a single machine, then different ports can be used for each server.</p>
<p><strong>enxTimeout</strong> (Java system prpery: zoeeper.cnxTimeout)
Sets the timeout value for opening connections for leader election notifications. Only applicable if you are using electionAlg 3. Default value 5 sec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
<p>The options in this section allow control over authentication/authorization performed by the service.</p>
<p><strong>zookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.superDigest</strong>
(Java system property only: zookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.superDigest)</p>
<p>By default this feature is disabled</p>
<p>New in 3.2: Enables a Zookeeper ensemble administrator to access the znode hierarchy as a&quot;super&quot; user. In particular, no ACL checking occurs for a user authenticated as super.</p>
<p>org. apache zookeeper. Server.auth. DigestAuthenticationProvider can be used to generate the superDigest, call it with one parameter of &quot;super : password&gt;. Provide the generated&quot;super :&lt; data&gt; as the system property value when starting each server of the ensemble.</p>
<p>When authenticating to a Zookeeper server from a Zookeeper client) pass a scheme of &quot; digest&quot; and authdata of super: password&gt;&quot;.Note that digest auth passes the authdata in plaintext to the server, it would be prudent to use this authentication method only on localhost(not over the network) or over an encrypted connection.</p>
<h3>Unsafe Options</h3>
<p>The following options can be useful, but be careful when you use them. The risk of each is explained along with the explanation of what the variable does</p>
<p><strong>forceSync</strong>(Java system property: zookeeper. forceSync)</p>
<p>Requires updates to be synced to media of the transaction log before finishing processing the update. If this option is set to no, ZooKeeper will not require updates to be synced to the media</p>
<p><strong>jute.maxbuffer</strong>:(Java system property: jute.maxbuffer)</p>
<p>This option can only be set as a Java system property. There is no zookeeper prefix on it. It specifies the maximum size of the data that can be stored in a znode. The default is Oxfffff, or just under IM. If this option is changed, the system property must be set on all servers and clients otherwise problems will arise. This is really a sanity check. ZooKeeper is designed to store data on the order of kilobytes in size</p>
<p><strong>skipACL</strong> (Java system property: zookeeper.skipACL)</p>
<p>Skips ACL checks. This results in a boost in throughput, but opens up full access to the data tree to everyone</p>
<p><strong>zookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.superDigest</strong> (Java system property only)</p>
<p>This system property specifies the digest for the &quot;super&quot;user&#39;s password (This feature is disabled by default, )A client that authenticates as super bypasses all ACL checking. The value of this system property will have the rm super: encoded digest. To generate</p>
<p>encoded digest use the org. apache zookeeper. server auth. DigestAuthentication Provider utility as follows</p>
<p>Java-cp SZK CLASSPATH I</p>
<p>org.apache zookeeper.server auth Digest Authentication Provider super: asdf</p>
<p>The following example command line generates an encoded digest for the password asdf.</p>
<p>super.asdt-&gt;super: T+-4Qoey4ZZ8Fnnil Y12GZtbH2W4</p>
<p>To start a server using this digest, you can use the following command:</p>
<p><strong>export SERVER JVMFLAGS</strong></p>
<p>SERVER JVMFLAGS--Dzookeeper DigestAuthentication Provider superDigest-</p>
<p>super: T+4Qoey4ZZ8Fnnil Y12GZtbH2W4=/bin/zkServersh</p>
<p>start Now, when connecting with zk Cli, you can issue the following:</p>
<p>[zk: localhost: 2181(CONNECTED) 0I]addauth digest super:asdf</p>
<p>[zk: localhost: 2181(CONNECTED) 1] At this point you are authenticated as the super user and will not be estricted by any ACLs</p>
<p>The connection between the ZooKeeper client and server is not encrypted, so the super password should not be used over untrusted links. The safest way to use the super password is to run the client using the super password on the same machine as the ZooKeeper server</p>
<h3>Monitoring a Zookeeper instance</h3>
<p>The Zookeeper service can be monitored in the following two ways</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring of health and status using a set of four-letter words</li>
<li>Using Java Management Extensions capabilities built into Zookeeper</li>

</ul>
<h3>Four-letter words</h3>
<p>Zookeeper responds to a small set of commands, each being composed of four letters. These commands can be issued through <code>telnet</code> or <code>nc</code> at the client port. The main objective of these commands is to provide a simple mechanism to check health of the server or diagnose any problems.</p>
<p>It is also easy to add new words to the server, so the list has been growing. In this section, we will point out some of the commonly used words</p>
<p><strong>ruok</strong> Provides (limited) information about the status of the server. If the server is running, it will respond with imok. It turns out that&quot;OK&quot; is a relative concept, though. For example, the server might be running but unable to communicate with the other servers in the ensemble, yet still report that it is &quot;OK &quot; For a more detailed and reliable health check, use the stat word.</p>
<p><strong>stat</strong> Provides information about the status of the server and the connections that are currently active. The status includes some basic statistics and whether the server is currently active, if it is a leader or follower, and the last zxid the server has seen. Some of the statistics are cumulative and can be reset using the srst word</p>
<p><strong>srvr</strong> Provides the same information as stat, except the connection information, which it omits.</p>
<p><strong>dump</strong> Provides session information, listing the currently active sessions and when they will expire. This word can be used only on a server that is acting as the leader.</p>
<p><strong>conf</strong> Lists the basic server configuration parameters that the server was started with
<strong>envi</strong> Lists various Java environment parameters
<strong>mntr</strong> Offers more detailed statistics than stat about the server. Each line of output has the format key value
(The leader will list some additional parameters that apply only to leaders
<strong>wchs</strong> Lists a brief summary of the watches tracked by the server.
<strong>wchc</strong> Lists detailed information on the watches tracked by the server, grouped by session
<strong>wchp</strong> Lists detailed information on the watches tracked by the server, grouped by the znode path being watched
<strong>cons,crst</strong> cons lists detailed ststistics for each connrction on a server and crst resets all the connection counters to zero.(((“cons”)).</p>
<p>Cluster monitoring means keeping track of server status; detect the failure of the servers, monitoring aliveness of the servers.</p>
<p><strong>connectString</strong>:This is a comma-separated list of host:port pairs.Every pair corresponds to ZooKeeper server.
<strong>sessionTimeout</strong>: This is the session timeout in milliseconds. This is the amount of time ZooKeeperwaits without getting a heartbeat from the client before declaring the session as dead.
<strong>watcher</strong>: A watcher object, which, if created, will be notified of state changes and node events. Thiswatcher object needs to be created separately through a user-defined class by implementing the Watcherinterface and passing the instantiated object to the ZooKeeper constructor. A client application can get anotification for various types of events such as connection loss, session expiry, and so on. We will lookat implementing a Watcher interface in the next section of this chapter.
<strong>sessionId</strong> : specific session id to use if reconnecting
<strong>sessionPasswd</strong> : password for this session
<strong>canBeReadOnly</strong> : (add in 3.4) whether the created client is allowed to go to read-only mode in case of partitioning. Read-only mode basically means that if the client can&#39;t find any majority servers but there&#39;s partitioned server it could reach, it connects to one in read-only mode, i.e. read requests are allowed while write requests are not. It continues seeking for majority in the background.</p>
<p>The <strong>DataMonitor</strong> will keep excuting continuously and keep listening to the NodeDataChange events from the Zookeeper server in a specific znode path called /MyConfiguration.</p>
<p>The <strong>DataUpdater</strong> class will periodically update the data field in this znode path,which will generate events,and upon occuring these events,the DataMonitor class will print the changed data onto the console. </p>
<h2>Curator</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction to Apache Curator</strong></p>
<p>Curator means- a keeper or custodian of a museum or other colletion - A Zookeeper Keeper.</p>
<p>Apache Curator is a Java/JVM client library for Apache Zookeeper, a distributed coordination service. It includes a high-level API framework and utilities to make using Apache Zookeeper much easier and moreliable. It also includes recipes for common use cases and extensions such as service discovery and a Java asynchronous DSL. Curator was originally developed by Netflix and is now an Apache project. Apache Curalor is a high-level wrapper library and framework that makes Zookeeper very simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>Apache Curator is meant to be used with Zookeeper 3.5+. However, it is also compatible with Zookeeper 3.4</p>
<p><strong>Curator Components</strong></p>
<p>Curator is a high-level library for Zookeeper; it makes dealing with Zookeeper much easier and it extends thefunctionality of core Zookeeper. At a high level, Curator is composed of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client</strong>: The Curator client is a wrapper around Zookeeper&#39;s Java client. It is a low-level API in thecurator stack and abstracts functionalities out of the Zookeeper client.</li>
<li><strong>Framework</strong>: The Curator framework is a high-level API with advanced features such as automaticconnection management, retrying of operations, and so on. It simplifies the usage of Zookeeper largely.</li>
<li><strong>Recipes</strong>: The Curator recipes provide implementations of Zookeeper recipes; these implementationscan be directly used in distributed applications to solve coordination problems.</li>
<li>Extensions: The Curator recipes package implements the common recipes. To avoid bloating thispackage, a separate extension package is used.</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the preceding components, Curator also ships with a bunch of useful utilities for Zookeeper. TheCurator stack is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>The Curator JARs are available in repositories of Maven Central. Curator can be easily included in the buildscripts of Maven,Gradle, Ivy, SBT, andSo on. The variousMavenartifacts arelisted at <a href='http://mvnrepository' target='_blank' class='url'>http://mvnrepository</a> .com/artifact/org.apache.curator.</p>
<p>Here, we assume that there is already a standalone Zookeeper instance running on 127.0.0.1:2181.First, we&#39;lneed to add the <code>curator-x-async</code> dependency to our <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class='language-xml' lang='xml'>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org. apache. curator&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;curator-x-async&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org. apache. zookeeper&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;zookeeper&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/exclusions&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Implementing Apache Curator</strong></p>
<p><strong>Curator client</strong>:Curator Client is a wrapper around Zookeeper&#39;s Java client.It makes client access to zookeper much simpler and less cror prone The curator client provdcethe following cappabilities:</p>
<p><strong>Connection management</strong>: This manages the connection to the Zookeeper server.The basic use case of Apache Curator is connecting to a running Apache Zookeeper instance. The tool provides a factory to build connection to Zookeeper using retry policies:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>int sleepMsBetweenRetries = 100;
int maxRetries = 3 ;
RetryPolicy retryPolicy = new RetryNTimes(maxRetries, sleepMsBetweenRetries);
CuratorFramework client = CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient(&quot;127.0.0.1:2181&quot;, retryPolicy);
client.start();
assertThat(client.checkExists().forPath(&quot;/&quot;)).isNotNull();
</code></pre>
<p>In this quick example, we will retry 3 times and will wait 100 ms between reries in case of conectivity issues.
Once connected to Zokeeper using the Curator Framework client, we can now browse paths, get/set data and essentially interact with the server.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration Management</strong></p>
<p>In a distributed environment, one of the most common challenges is to manage shared configuration amany applications. We can use Zookeeper as a data store where to keep our configuration.</p>
<p>Let us see an example using Apache Curator to get and set data:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>CuratorFramework client = newClient();
client.start();
AsyncCuratorFramework async = AsyncCuratorFramework.wrap(client);
String key = getKey();
String expected = &quot;my_value&quot;;
client.create ().forPath(key);
async setData().forPath(key, expected.getBytes());
AtomicBoolean isEquals = new AtomicBoolean() ;
async.getData().forPath(key).thenAccept(data -&gt; isEquals.set(new String (data).equals (expected)));
await().until(() -&gt; assertThat(isEquals.get()).isTrue()) ;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we create the node path, set the data in Zookeeper, and then we recover it checking that the value is the same. The key field could be a node path like <code>/config/dev/my_key</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Test Zookeeper server</strong></p>
<p>Test server for testing a sample code fragment of the MyCuratorClient.java file to connect to the Zookeeper server with the curator client is shown this Zookeeper as follows:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>public void myCuratorClient() throws Exception {
    CuratorZookeeperClient client = new CuratorZookeeperClient (server.getConnectString(), 10000, 10000, null,new RetryOneTime(1)) ;
    client.start();
    try {
        client.blockUntilConnectedOrTimedout();
        String path = client.getZooKeeper().create(&quot;/test_znode&quot;, &quot;&quot;.getBytes(), ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode.PERSISTENT);
    } finally {
        client.close();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Curator Zookeeper Client constructor is used to connect to the Zookeeper server. It takes a connectionstring or a list of Zookeeper host-port pairs, the session and connection timeout, an optional watcher object, anthe retry policy to use. A retry policy is a mechanism for the client to try various retry mechanisms whilretrying connections. In the preceding example, we used a policy where the client will retry only once.</p>
<p><strong>Operations retry utilities</strong></p>
<p>This is a mechanism to retry operations The Curator client supports the following retry policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>BoundedExponentialBackoffRetry: This retries a specified number of time by inersing the sleep time between the retries up to a maximum upper bound,</li>
<li>ExponentialBackoffRetry: This retries a specified number of times by increasing the sleep timebetween the retries</li>
<li>RetryNTimes: This retries n number of times.</li>
<li>RetryOneTime: This retries only once.</li>
<li>RetryUntilElapsed: This retries until a specified timeout has elapsed Once the client is started, the block Until Connected or TimedOut method blocks until the connection to the Zookeeper server succeeds or the connection timeout has elapsed. Once the connection succeeds, we will create a znode named /test_znode. The get Zookeeper () method returns the instance of the onnection to the managedZookeeper server.</li>

</ul>
<p>The Curator client is a low-level API that gives an abstraction over the Zookeeper client APIs. Developersshould use the Curator framework instead of directly using the CuratorZookeeperClient class in their applications as a recommended practice.</p>
<p>Curator framework</p>
<p>The Curator framework (org.apache.curator.framework) is a high-level API that simplifies using Zookeeper largely. Some of the features it provides are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatie Connection Management: This feature automatically and transparently handles thescenarios where clients need to reereate a connection to the Zookeeper server and/or retry operations.</li>
<li>Simple and Flexible APIs: This feature applies the raw Zookeeper API with a set of modern, fluent interfaces.</li>
<li>Recipes: This feature implements common Zookeeper recipes. We will discuss them in the next section.</li>

</ul>
<p>Curator Framework is allocated using Curator Framework Factory. It provides the factory methods as well as a builder to create instances. Curator Framework instances are fully thread-safe,</p>
<p>While developing applications using Curator Framework, developers should create and share one Curator Framework instance for every Zookeeper cluster. The Curator Framework uses a fluent-style interface. A sample Zookeeper client using Curator Framework is shown in the following code snippet:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>public void myCuratorFrameworkClient() throws Exception {
    CuratorFramework client =
    CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient (server.getConnectstring() , new RetryOneTime(1));
    client.start();
    try {
    string path =
    client.create().withMode( CreateMode.PERSISTENT) . forPath( &quot;/test_znode&quot;,&quot;&quot;.getBytes()) ;
    } finally {
    client. close(); 

    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>The newClient() factory method creates a new client instance with the defaut session timeout and default conection timeout. lt takes a conection string that is a list of zookeeper host-port pairs and the retry policy touse. Curator Framework has a concept of a namespace. With this, it is possible to set the namespace whencreating a Curator Framework instance with the builder. The framework prepends the namespace to all paths when one of its API is called:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>CuratorFrameworkFactory.Builder builder = CuratorFrameworkFactory.builder();
CuratorFramework client = builder.connectString
(server .getConnectString()).namespace (&quot;MyApp&quot;).retryPolicy (new
RetryOneTime (1)).buildl);
client. create() . forPath(&quot;/test_ znode&quot;, data) ;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, although the name of the znode is specified as /test_znode, the actual znode that gets created is /MyApptest znode.</p>
<p>The Curator framework also provides a limited-feature framework interface named Curator Temp Framework for temporary connections over unreliable networks, such as a WAN. In this framework, the ZooKeeper connection is closed if the session remains idle for some time.</p>
<p>Curator Recipes</p>
<p>Zookeeper provides this guideline to implement high-level solutions or recipes such as leader clection,distributed locks or shared counters. Apache Curator provides an implementation for most of these recipes. All of these recipes are available in a separate module:</p>
<pre><code class='language-xml' lang='xml'>&lt;dependency&gt;
&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.curator&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;curator-recipes&lt;/artifactld&gt;
&lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Let us jump right in and start understanding these with some simple examples.</p>
<p>Leader Election</p>
<p>In a distributed environment, we may need one master or leader node tocoordinate a complex job. Curator provides two algorithms for leader elction: leader latch and leader selector.</p>
<p>Both the agoritims select a &quot;leader&quot; among the multiple contenders conected to the zookeeper cluster. If a group of n participants contends for leadership with leader latch, one an. among the n participants is randomly sigedaleaer whle with leader sletor a leader is selcte in the order of requsts coming to the Zookeeper server. When the leader releases its leadership,another contender from the group of n paricipants in the cluster is chosen.</p>
<p>This is how the usage of the Leader Election recipe in Curator looks like:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>CuratorFramework client = newClient() ;
client. start();
Ladesletor lenderselector - new Leaderselector (client,
&quot;/mutex/select/leader/for/job/A&quot;,
new LeaderSelectorListener(){

@Override

public void ฿stateChanged(
 เCuratorFramework client,
ConnectionState newState) {
}

@Override

bub1ie void takeLeadership(

curatorFramework elient) throws Exception {
}

}) ;

// join the members group

leaderSelector.start() ;

// wait unti1 the job A is done among all members

leaderSelector.close(); 
</code></pre>
<p>When we start the leaderselector, our node joins a members group within the path/mutex/seit/leader/for/job/A. Once our node becomes the leader, the takeLeadership method will be invoked, and we as leaders can resume the job.</p>
<p>Shared Locks</p>
<p>Curator implements the following different types of distributed locks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared re-entrant lock: This type of lock provides globally synchronous fully distributed locks.</li>
<li>Shared lock: This is non re-entrant shared re-entrant lock.</li>
<li>Shared re-entrant read/write lock: This re-entrant read/write mutex works across JVMs.</li>
<li>Shared semaphore: This counting semaphore works across JV Ms.</li>

</ul>
<p>Multishared lock: This is used to manage multiple locks as a single entity.</p>
<p>An acquire 0 call acquires all the locks. If the call fails, all the acquired paths are released. A release() call releases all the managed locks,</p>
<p>The Shared Lock recipe is about having a fully distributed lock:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>CuratorFramework client = newClient() ;
client.start() ;
InterProcessSemaphoreMutex sharedLock = new InterProcessSemaphoreMutex (เclient, &quot;/mutex/process/A&quot;) ;
sharedLock . acquire() ;
// do process A
sharedLock.release() ;
</code></pre>
<p>when we acquire the lock, zookeeper ensures that there is no other application acquiring the same lock at the same time.</p>
<p>Counters</p>
<p>This provides a mechanism to manage a shared integer with a shared counter. It also gives a mechanism for distributed atomic1ncrements with distributed atomic long, distributed atomic integer, and distributed atomic value.</p>
<p>The Counters recipe coordinates a shared Integer among all the clients:</p>
<pre><code class='language-java' lang='java'>CuratorFramework client = newClient();
client.start() ;
SharedCount counter = new SharedCount (client, &quot; /counters/A&quot;, 0) ;
counter.start () ;
counter.setcount(counter.getCount() + 1) ;
assertThat(counter.getcount()).isEqualTo(1) ;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, Zookeeper stores the Integer value in the path /counters/A and initializes the value to 0 if the path has not been created yet,</p>
<p>Recipes Curator provides a bunch of ready-to-use recipes for Zookeeper. A detailed listing and description forthe recipes implemented by Curator can be read from the project page at <a href='http://curator.apacheorg/curator-recipes/index.html' target='_blank' class='url'>http://curator.apacheorg/curator-recipes/index.html</a>, Here, we will go through brief outlines of the Zookeeper recipes in Curator:</p>
<p>Cache</p>
<p>Caching is implemented through the path cache, node cache, and tree cache recipes to keep the data of change instates of znodes, locally cached nodes and all the locally cached children of a ZK path respectively.</p>
<p>Queues</p>
<p>This provides distributed queue implementation. The following different types of queues are supported:
Distributed queue: This is a simple distributed queue where items put into the queue are ordered inFIFO.</p>
<p>Distributed ID queue: This is a version of distributed queue that allows some identifiers to be associated with queue items.</p>
<p>Distributed priority queue: This is an implementation of the distributed priority queue of Zookeeper.Internally, it uses a distributed queue where a priority can be specified to the items.</p>
<p>Distributed delay queue: This is a variation of the distributed priority queue that uses time as the priority. When items are added to the queue, a delay value is given. The item will not be sent to a consumer until the time elapses.</p>
<p>Simple distributed queue: This is part of the Zookeeper distribution. This is a replacement of the org.apache.zookeeper.recipes.queue.DistributedQueue queue implementation.</p>
<p>Nodes</p>
<p>This provides a recipe for a persistent ephemeral node; this is an ephemeral node that attempts to stay present in Zookeeper, even with connection and session interruptions.</p>
<p>Curator utilities</p>
<p>The Curator library also provides a collection of useful utilities for Zookeeper. Some of these are shown here.
Test server: This local, in-process Zookeeper server can be used for testing.</p>
<p>Test cluster: This is an internally running ensemble of Zookeeper servers for testing.</p>
<p>ZKPaths: This provides various static methods to use the Zookeeper znode paths.</p>
<p>EnsurePath: This is a utility to ensure that a particular znode path is created before use.</p>
<p>BlockingQueueConsumer: This is a queue consumer similar to Java&#39;s BlockingQueue.</p>
<p>Reaper: This is a utility to delete paths with no children and nodes with no data.</p>
