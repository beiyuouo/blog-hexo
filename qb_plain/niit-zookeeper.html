The minimum recommended number of servers is three, and five is the most common in a production environment. The replicated group of servers in the same application domain is called a quorum. In this mode, the ZooKeeper server instance runs on multiple different machines, and all servers in the quorum have copies of the same configuration file.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Setting up multimode ZooKeeper cluster</td><td style='text-align:center;' >1.12</td><td>initLimit &amp; syncLimit</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Starting the server instances</td><td style='text-align:center;' >1.13</td><td>Commands &amp; their use and syntax</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>The ZooKeeper data model</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.3</td><td>The data registers are known as znodes in the ZooKeeper.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>The ZooKeeper data model</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.4</td><td>Every znode in the ZooKeeper data model maintains a stat structure. A stat simply provides the metadata of a znode. It consists of Version number, Action control list (ACL), Timestamp and Data length.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.5</td><td>ZooKeeper has primarily two types of znodes: persistent and ephemeral. There is a third type called a sequential znode, which is a kind of a qualifier for the other two types. Both persistent and ephemeral znodes can be sequential znodes as well. A znode&#39;s type is set at the time of its creation.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES - The Persistent Znode</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.5</td><td>The persistent znodes have a lifetime in the ZooKeeper&#39;s namespace until these are explicitly deleted. A znode can be deleted by calling the delete API call.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES - The ephemeral znode</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.5</td><td>An ephemeral znode is deleted by the ZooKeeper service when the creating client&#39;s session ends</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES - The ephemeral znode</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.5</td><td>An ephemeral znode is deleted by the ZooKeeper service when the creating client&#39;s session ends</td><td>&quot;-e flag&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES - The sequential znode</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.6</td><td>A sequential znode is assigned a sequence number by ZooKeeper as a part of its name during its creation.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>Types of ZNODES - The sequential znode</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.6</td><td>Since both persistent and ephemeral znodes can be sequential znodes, there are a total of four modes of znodes: persistent  ephemeral  persistent_sequential  ephemeral_sequential</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper Watches</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.6</td><td>ZooKeeper has the mechanism where clients can get notifications from the ZooKeeper service instead of looking for events (pull model) in the registry. This is similar to a push model, where notifications are pushed to the registered clients of the ZooKeeper service. Watches are a simple mechanism for the client to get notifications about the changes in the ZooKeeper ensemble. Clients can set watches while reading a particular znode. Watches send a notification to the registered client for any of the znode (on which client registers) changes. Znode changes are modification of data associated with the znode or changes in the znode’s children. Watches are triggered only once. If a client wants a notification again, it must be done through another read operation. When a connection session is expired, the client will be disconnected from the server and the associated watches are also removed. Watches are maintained in the ZooKeeper server to which a client is connected, and this makes it a fast and lean method of event notification.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper operations</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.8</td><td>Operation with their description</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper operations</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.9</td><td>Read requests are processed locally in the ZooKeeper server &amp; Write requests are forwarded to the leader.</td><td>Remember</td></tr><tr><td>ZooKeeper operations</td><td style='text-align:center;' >2.9</td><td>All of the read operations in ZooKeeper - getData(), getChildren(), and exists() - have the option of setting a watch for notification to the client.
